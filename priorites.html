					<h3>Taking on the tough issues facing conservation today. The Nature Conservancy is taking on the tough issues facing conservation today - from climate change to coral reefs, to energy development in a growing world. We are applying high level strategies to our conservation work around the world in the following areas:</h3>
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/water/index.htm" class="link">PROTECTING WATER </a><br> We are working to protect rivers, lakes and watersheds; transform the way river systems are managed and developed; and inspire people to get involved.
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/index.htm" class="link">ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE </a><br> Working for solutions that will reduce emissions to levels compatible with a healthy planet, preserve forests and help nature adapt to global warming.
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/oceanscoasts/index.htm" class="link">SAVING OCEANS </a><br> Oceans provide half of the oxygen we breathe, food and livelihoods for millions around the globe, medicines to treat disease and support for our thriving coastal economies. How can we continue to use our oceans and protect them at the same time?
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/land-conservation/index.htm" class="link">CONSERVING LAND </a><br> Sustaining the world's land resources is where the Conservancy's story began. Today, we are guided by our vision to conserve land at an unprecedented scale - for the benefit of people, wildlife, and our climate. Ours is a mission to transform how land is developed, used and conserved, doing more to unlock the true potential for green growth.
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/nature-in-cities/index.htm" class="link">TRANSFORMING CITIES </a><br> Across the globe, people are moving into cities at a faster rate than ever in our history. And cities are in a precarious position - rapid growth has the potential to make them deeply unlivable places, at the mercy of floods, droughts and storms. We know that nature can help cities manage the challenges they face.

					<h2 class="head1">HOW WE WORK</h2>
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/science-in-action/index.htm" class="link">OUR SCIENCE</a><br> The Conservancy is a world leader in cutting-edge conservation science with 550 staff scientists around the globe.
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/science-in-action/conservation-by-design/index.htm" class="link">CONSERVATION BY DESIGN</a><br> For more than a decade, The Nature Conservancy's work has been guided by a framework we call Conservation by Design - a systematic approach that determines where to work, what to conserve, what strategies we should use and how effective we have been.
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/about-us/diversity/index.htm" class="link">PURSUING DIVERSITY</a><br> The Nature Conservancy has a strong and abiding commitment to diversity in its workforce and in the people and groups with which it works. We recognize the Conservancy's mission is best advanced by the leadership and contributions of men and women of diverse backgrounds, beliefs and cultures.
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/about-us/working-with-companies/index.htm" class="link">WORKING WITH COMPANIES</a><br> For decades, The Nature Conservancy has recognized that the private sector has an important role to play in advancing our conservation mission. We are applying our science, reach, expertise in conservation planning, and on-the-ground experience to help businesses make better decisions, understand the value of nature, and protect it.
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://www.nature.org/about-us/conservation-note.xml" class="link">INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION FINANCE</a><br> The Conservancy has financed hundreds of millions of dollars in conservation, protection and restoration throughout the years, and has been at the cutting edge of science, land conservation and innovative financing solutions. We are always testing new ways to further our reach - like the Conservation Note which allows individual and institutional investors to put their money where their values are by investing in Conservancy projects around the globe.
